# TCP_VIDEO_STREAMING_SERVER

This is a TCP video streaming server. ( Not how actual
video streaming servers work but they work for this Project)
Our
server reads a video file frame by frame and sends them to the
client. The client receives the raw data, reconstitutes them into
video, and plays it.
1. To launch the server use server_script.py
2. To launch the client, use client_script,py
3. Change path_to_video_file variable in server.py with a path to a video file on your machine.

4. You will require cv2 for this. You can install opencv from
[opencv-python Â· PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
## Run Locally in Terminal

To launch the server

```bash
  python3 server_script.py
```

 To launch the client

```bash
  python3 client_script.py
```



## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?


1. Networking concepts: I learned about the TCP protocol, which is a core part of the Internet's infrastructure. I also learn about how to send and receive data over a network using sockets.

2. Video encoding and decoding: For this project, I need to understand how video is encoded and stored in order to stream it over the network. I also learned how to decode the video on the client side.
